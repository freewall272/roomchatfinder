<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement</h2>
<p>We take claims of copyright infringement seriously. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the &ldquo;<strong>DMCA</strong>&rdquo;) or any other applicable intellectual property legislation or laws. Responses may include removing, blocking, or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity, terminating the user&rsquo;s access to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.RoomChatFinder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.RoomChatFinder.com</a>&nbsp;(&ldquo;<strong>RoomChatFinder</strong>&rdquo;), or all of the foregoing.</p>
<p>If you believe any material accessible on RoomChatFinder infringes your copyright, you may submit a copyright infringement notification (see below, &ldquo;Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement&rdquo; for instructions on filing such a notice). These requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner, or an agent authorized to act on the owner&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>All copyright infringement notifications must be written in English. Any attempted notifications written in foreign languages or using foreign characters may, at our discretion, be deemed non-compliant and disregarded.</p>
